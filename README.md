# Tina's Tots
## Code Institute Milestone Project One - UCD

A 5 page static website for a home based child minding business. The site consists of a landing page with a short headline that encourages visitors to make contact. This scrolls down into a section that gives the visitor information on Tina, the child minder, and also the services she offers. 

The other pages in the site continue to build on the information already offered by creating a picture of what parents can expect when their child is placed in Tina's care. The final page is a contact form that allows the visitor to call Tina direct, or fill out a form and have Tina contact them.

The current deployed version can be found at https://tinas-tots-steview.c9users.io (THIS REQUIRES UPDATING!)

This site acts as a sales tool for the services provided by Tina's Tots.
The site should not provide every last detail and instead provide enough information to make the visitor want to get in touch and find out more.
The site should provide multiple ways of making contact, and this information should be easily accessible from any part of the site.

## Testing

This site has been extensively tested in a number of ways.

The Chrome Dev Tools have been used to test all pages at all widths across numerous simulated devices to confirm pages display exactly as intended.
The simulated devices tested were
- Galaxy S5
- Google Pixel 2
- iPhone 5/SE, 6/7/8, and X
- iPad & iPad Pro

Dev tools were also used to test between the widths of 300px up to 3840px and the pages remain intact and fully responsive.

I have also tested on the following physical devices, and again, no issues have been encountered.
- Windows desktop at HD, QHD, and UWQHD resolutions
- Google Pixel 2XL
- Apple iPhone 8S

The sites main purpose is to allow the visitor and owner to contact each other, so this functionality has been tested. There are 2 methods of contact provided.


A telephone number.

- A contact telephone number is displayed in 2 areas of the site - the landing page and contact page
- When touched on a mobile device, it enters the mobile number into the phone ready to make a call.

A contact form.

- The contact form checks to make sure the 2 required fields are completed - name & telephone number.
- If you try, an error message informs you that the field is required, and to complete it before submitting.
- The reset button works to clear the form of any data entered.
- The form is not currently linked to an external server so when the user presses send, the form resets itself.
- Implementing this functionality was outside of the scope of this project, but will be added at a later date.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
